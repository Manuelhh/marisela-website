      "Artistic-psychoeducational intervention with a gender perspective that was carried out during 2021 and 2022 at Centro Artístico, Lúdico y Cultural (CALUC) that is part of DIF Zapopan (Decentralized Public Organization of the municipality of Zapopan). Aimed at women between 14 and 24 years of age who live in the north of the municipality of Zapopan and who are in situations of vulnerability. La Cuerpa que Somos consisted of a series of workshops given by specialists in the areas of sexuality, creation of support networks and self-defense, in which the participants acquired knowledge and useful tools for social development within their contexts. The workshops were a preamble full of enriching experiences that helped the participants form a cohesive group and create an environment conducive to carrying out collaborative artistic activity, which revolved around the body of women and its meanings. In La Cuerpa activity, the participants wore white garments while we talked about what it means to inhabit the physical body and how it has been symbolically constructed by social factors that affect the way it is meant from the individual dimension. The white garments that took the shape of the body of their wearers, as a canvas, were intervened with words and drawings at the same time that knowledge, desires and experiences were shared in an atmosphere of intimacy and trust.",

      "Artistic-educational intervention in which students of various ages from Preparatoria 7 (ages 15 to 18) of the Universidad de Guadalajara participated. The Asociación de Dibujantes was created with the intention that the participants develop their creativity and stimulate their expressive capacity through drawing. The only requirement to enter was the taste for drawing, it was emphasized that it was not important not to know how to do it. Each participant created a folder in which they compiled the exercises of the sessions, where introspection and the encounter with the creative process itself were sought. During the sessions, the results and experiences that were presented were shared, as well as proposals for new exercises for future meetings. The project lasted one year in face-to-face format, in 2018 and continued virtually in the first half of 2019.",

      "I express and I exist. In 2008 and 2009, I worked as an art educator and cultural manager at the DIF Zapopan, where I designed and executed programs for the development of creativity through art aimed at children and adolescents living on the streets of marginalized neighborhoods in extreme poverty situation of the Zapopan municipality. Among the actions with the greatest impact during the time I worked with these populations are the creativity workshops, in which the participants were able to experiment in a playful way with different languages ​​of art, such as painting, drawing, collage, photography, video and music; in addition to knowing and using different forms of expression with which they gave voice to their ideas, stories and desires. The workshops were held in 12 neighborhoods and attended to more than 300 children and adolescents. As part of the activities, visits were made to the Regional Museum of Guadalajara and the Zapopan Art Museum. The program closed significantly at the now-defunct El Colectivo culture center with an exhibition of the works, the projection of audiovisual documentary material from the workshops, and with the participation of a group of graffiti artists from Zapopan and Guadalajara who carried out a activity called “The train of illusions” (wooden wagons painted by children and graffiti artists together).",

      "The artistic-educative intervention that carried to my final paper for my Master’s Degree in Art Education and Expression occurred during the year 2016 during a school semester. Use of metaphorical thought in photographic experimentation. Didactic strategy for the development of creativity, consisted in the systemized execution and observation of activities as a laboratory to develop the creativity in students of the digital photography subject in the fifth semester of the Preparatoria 7 of the University of Guadalajara. Every week, for three hours, the students attended a laboratory session during which spaces were opened for experimentation with physical elements such as paper, paint, design materials, printed and digital photographs; and symbolic elements such as metaphors and stories, with the intention of mobilizing intuition and observation and, in this way, addressing the manipulation of images as a means of activating the poetic gaze.   The students who participated recorded the processes of each session in a diary that accounts for the reflections on their creations, which allowed me to observe the metacognitive depth they reached. At the same time, I made a photographic and video record, as well as a journal of notes, which I used to triangulate the information collected. The teaching strategies program was well received by the students; his products and reflections, as well as my own observations, revealed important elements of his creative development. ",
